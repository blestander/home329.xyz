                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>
                    There are multiple ways to install Minecraft modpacks, whether manual or using a launcher.
                    These instructions will explain how to do so using
                    <a>Prism Launcher</a>,
                    but any other launcher that supports mods from CurseForge,
                    such as the CurseForge app or ATLauncher,
                    could also be used.
                </p>

                        Select Add Instance from the top bar,
                        select CurseForge from the column on the left side,
                        select (or search up) "All the Mods 10 - ATM10",
                        and then click OK.
                        Feel free to name or group your instance as you wish, as this will not affect your ability to play.

                        When a window pops up telling you that Prism was unable to download some mods,
                        click the "Open Missing" button.
                        Click through all of the tabs that will have opened,
                        triggering the download on each of them.
                        Then, return to Prism and select OK.

                        Please note that it may take several minutes to load terrain,
                        and the Minecraft window may appear non-responsive.
                        This, unfortunately, is normal for ATM 10.
